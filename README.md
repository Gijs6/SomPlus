# SomPlus
Looks at changes in the grades and schedule via the [Somtoday API](https://github.com/elisaado/somtoday-api-docs).
Relies on the files refreshtoken.txt, gradelist.pkl, schedule.pkl, week_number.txt and standard_schedule.pkl. You can replace the .pkl for .json if you want.
The Somtoday API auth is a mess. I use [Somtoday SSO tool](https://github.com/m-caeliusrufus/Somtoday-SSO-tool) to get the refreshtoken, and put that in the refreshtoken.txt
